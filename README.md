Integrating your client with the HidingBook enables your users to coordinate with KeeperDAO keepers and directly participate in the MEV (miner extractable value) capture process.  This is a win-win because both users and keepers are working together to maximize profit generation from a trade the user was going to perform anyways. 

### User benefits
* Protected against invisible slippage
* Protected against sandwich trading attacks 
* Pay zero gas to trade
* Get rewarded in $ROOK for your participation in MEV capture, which results in you trading at a better price than you asked for

### Keeper benefits
* No gas auctions
* Maximized profit opportunities
* No gas tokens required to trade efficiently
* Avoid the mempool front running battles

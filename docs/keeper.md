# Keeper integration guide
For the time being, only trusted keepers will be keeping on the Hiding Game until we implement a system that can verify profit generated by all keepers for any given transaction. Once we implement a system to handle that scenario, we'll open up the Hiding Game to any keeper wanting to join. More details will be announced in the near future.  

## Phase 1: Only one internal keeper
This is the current phase. Keep it simple with one keeper bot while we work out the kinks and prepare to onboard more keepers. 

## Phase 2: Coordination a few more trusted keepers 
This is where we introduce the first keeper coordination system. This will be with trusted and experienced keepers only while we improve our coordination process. If you'd like to be involved in this phase, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/G9mWtTC). We suggest that you have a good variety of DEX integrations for facilitating trade. We require that you integrate with [0xv4](https://0xprotocol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) so that you can facilitate our user's trades. 

## Phase 3: Onboard & Coordination any and all keepers 
More on this in the future.
